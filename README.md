# HAB-Data-Logger
Full open-source data logger for high altitude balloon

I have always dreamed of sending something to space.  Until recently, this was just simply not an option for the average hobbyist.  When I became involved in developing on the Arduino platform I realized that all of the instrumentation, tracking and control were now relatively easy to produce with very little cost.
This year a friend prompted me to revisit this dream (over a drink of course) and I took it up with a renewed interest.  We basically decided that we would send a balloon into “near space” in time to meet the Stanford high Altitude Balloon Challenge ” in April 2014.
Quickly I began work on the electronics, enclosure, data logging, temperature control and other various systems.  My fellow friends/team members are charged with the rigging, recovery, flight predictions and several other project needs.
Between all of us- we should have a workable DIY Space Mission in time for the April Launch.
All aspects of the build are being documented and shared via YouTube.
